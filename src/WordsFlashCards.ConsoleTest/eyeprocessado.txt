----------------------------
rags
In disbelief he stared at a bony little man with long arms and a big nose shoving hurriedly through the crowd in clothes that looked like a bundle of rags
He straightened his rags as if they were feastday clothes
Mat grew impatient when they found nothing but dust or rubble or colorless rags of wall hangings that crumbled at a touch
Men with twisted bodies and the women worse all dirty and in rags
The gleeman s clothes hung in charred rags that made him see the flashes of light as Thom wrestled with the Fade to give them time to run
The flesh under the rags was blackened and burned
His muscles ached like wrung out rags and had about as much strength
The stooped shape that shuffled hesitantly out into the open looked more like a pile of filthy rags than a man
He had forgotten all about that bundle of rags of a man
Contemptuously he flicked his fingers against the rags he wore
----------------------------
thunder
Inside the room wood splintered like thunder
Thunder rumbled in the depths of the valley and lightning crackled through the gray sometimes striking up at the sky
They closed behind him with an echoing crash like thunder
A hundred brazen throated trumpets shiver the air and drums rattle like thunder
Drums thunder and cymbals sing
The first slow peal of thunder rumbled across Four Kings
Thunder rattled the windows
Only the thunder overpowered the noise in the common room
Thunder grumbled and a bolt of lightning streaked above the inn
The crash of the thunder seemed to be inside his skull
A crash of thunder rattled the windows and he glanced significantly at the ceiling then gave them a toothy grin
Hastily he shoved them under the door and when the next roll of thunder rattled the inn drove them in with two quick kicks of his heel
The thunder faded and he held his breath listening
Thunder rolled and they heaved
Timing themselves to peals of thunder and lightning cracks they heaved on the crowbar again and again
Thunder muttered overhead and was drowned in a slash of lightning
The rain had continued through the night they staggered away from The Dancing Cartman hammering at them as hard as the thunder out of a black sky split by lightning
Thunder crashed overhead and Mat stumbled almost falling almost pulling him down too
Lightning split the dark right above them as Mat spoke and the thunder crack pounded every other sound into the ground but in the flash Rand could make the name on Mat s lips
Thunder smote her ears so hard she thought her knees would buckle as a jagged trident stabbed the ground just beyond the horses splashing dirt and rocks like a fountain
Thunder drummed wildly one roar rumbling into the next one continuous rippling peal
Fear stricken horses screamed their whinnies drowned except for moments when the thunder faded
Echoes of thunder rolled across the sky before they too faded away
Their shouts drowned out by the thunder of drums and trumpets but waiting still
The Golden Bees of Illian the three White Crescents of Tear the Rising Sun of Cairhien others many others of nations and of cities and of great men with their own trumpets their own drums to thunder their grandeur
Loial said an emphatic rumble like thunder
The normal distant thunder of Loial s voice was muted
The thousand murmurs that hid in the wind roared like thunder roars of madness half heard voices cackling and howling promises that twisted Rand s stomach as much by the pleasure in them as by what he almost understood them to say
Loial s sigh was a rumble like thunder on the horizon
The ground rumbled with the thunder of hooves as the forces of humankind launched their last charge
----------------------------
gulping
Rand sagged gulping air and scrubbing cold sweat off his face with his sleeve
Gulping huge breaths of the fresh cold wind he laughed with the exhilaration of it
----------------------------
mantle
Nynaeve was closing the mantle on a second lit lantern
----------------------------
officers
He caught sight under the edge of one dark robe of the silver worked boots of a High Lord of Tear and under another a glimpse of golden lion head spurs worn only by high officers in the Andoran Queen s Guards
----------------------------
responsibility
Jordan has brought a completely new allegory in a fantasy concept that goes even beyond this massive story working with an artist s eye and the sense of responsibility of a serious historian
The only ill word I heard about you was from a few who thought you too young for the responsibility and that only strengthened my suspicions
A position of great responsibility and authority both actual and implied
Women s Circle A group of women elected by the women of a village responsible for deciding such matters as are considered solely women s responsibility for example when to plant the crops and when to harvest
Equal in authority to the Village Council with clearly delineated lines and areas of responsibility
----------------------------
jerkily
Rand struggled to reach the sword to move to get but his arms and legs moved jerkily and only half as he wanted
----------------------------
titles
His eyes gobbled up the titles picking out old favorites
My Lord Egwene was saying as glibly as if she had been using titles all of her life I thought he was a Warder but you call him Dai Shan and talk about a Golden Crane banner and so did those other men
He denies his titles yet in the Borderlands he is called the Uncrowned and if ever he raised the Golden Crane of Malkier an army would come follow
----------------------------
bodies
Rand glimpsed a misshapen head topped by spike like horns before Tam struck again and two huge bodies blocked the door
The bodies in the doorway jerked as others outside tried to pull them clear
Four twisted bodies made a tangle in the remnants of the furnishings
Fire consumed their bodies and terror consumed their just victorious army
Heavy bodies crowded shoulder to shoulder around him
Desperately he searched for her as he kicked the gray onward slashing a path through the hairy bodies as though chopping undergrowth
Night after night he bolted upright in the dark panting and reaching for his axe before he realized the wagons were not in flames that no bloody muzzled shapes snarled over torn and twisted bodies littering the ground
I believe we disposed of four or five but it is unlikely we will find any bodies given the Darkfriends propensity for carrying their dead to hide their losses
The buildings shook with the racket and the smell was sour a stench of old wine and unwashed bodies
Sour wine fumes and the stench of dirty sweating bodies made his head swim and the din of voices beat at him till his eyes blurred and even the sound of his own flute scratched at his ears
Again and again the door trembled as bodies hurled themselves at it
Shivering he carefully guided Mat around the bodies
Men with twisted bodies and the women worse all dirty and in rags
People crowded against him from both sides sweating from the press of so many bodies
Gray and pitted like the stone the huge bodies were half sunken in the swollen bubbled surface
Too loud as if half decayed trees were being crushed by huge bodies slithering over them
Fades in hundreds rode across the front of the horde the fierce muzzled faces of Trollocs turning away in fear as they passed huge bodies pulling back to make way
He could see the Draghkar clearly soulless eyes in pale men s faces on winged bodies that had nothing of humanity about them
----------------------------
easing
They went up the stairs warily Perrin easing his axe in its belt loop
----------------------------
pass
Author unknown the Fourth Age CHAPTER An Empty Road The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend
But you give them just the thought of Aes Sedai and a false Dragon in Ghealdan and soon enough they ll start thinking that Ghealdan is not that far the other side of the Forest of Shadows and a straight line from Tar Valon to Ghealdan wouldn t pass that much to the east of us
He did not try to pass Rand or even come close to him
A tingle ran through him with every pass
If I damaged it enough to let you pass drawing that much of the One Power would pull the Halfmen like a trumpet call
The path you re following the line you ve taken the last two days you ll pass a hundred miles or more north of Caemlyn
Her loathing outweighed her pain but she had a message so important to her that she must pass it to someone even us before she died
We want to pass through Whitebridge so softly that nobody remembers we were here five minutes after we re gone
Stables and horse lots lined the streets all of which were wide enough to allow wagons to pass and deeply rutted from too many wheels
Holding him upright Mat waited impatiently for a horse cart approaching from the village to pass them
The village folk stood in knots talking among themselves and watching the steady stream pass by
He waited for a stableman to pass leading a horse and even then he lowered his voice
and Lan seemed to lean casually aside letting the blade pass so close he must have felt the wind of it
There had to be places from where he could see the procession pass with the false Dragon
Go easy when you pass through a Waygate Rand Loial cautioned
It could not pass Moiraine said
They began to pass farms but though it was the hour for midday meals to be cooking no smoke rose from the high stone chimneys
It covered an entire wall and showed men armored like the men of Fal Dara fighting Myrddraal and Trollocs in a mountain pass
I am sometimes taken by spells but that will pass soon
He could see the route they must climb once they reached the mountains the twisting path and the high pass beyond like an axe blow cleaving into the black stone
He stood in a broad mountain pass surrounded by jagged black peaks like the teeth of the Dark One
None seemed to notice Rand as they paid a few last strokes and broke away galloping or running a stagger to the ends of the pass
Rand found himself facing the end of the pass where the humans were re forming pennants stirring beneath gleaming lancepoints
The wind rose with his voice howled with his voice roared with his voice down the pass whipping the flames to a wall of fire that sped away from him and toward the Trolloc host faster than a horse could run
Dust and smoke swirled back the pass to surround him

laundry
Now his name came up whenever a washline dropped the laundry in the dirt or a loose saddle girth deposited a farmer in the road
She was about to do laundry and some of her husband s old clothes would fit them well enough for working
----------------------------
routine
It was a nightly routine
----------------------------
Albhain
In turn that was followed by The Fall of Aleth Loriel and Gaidal Cain s Sword and The Last Ride of Buad of Albhain
----------------------------
everrising
Ripples ran through the ground ahead of him in everrising waves waves of dirt and rock towering over Trollocs and Fades breaking over them as the mountains shattered under their hooved feet
----------------------------
moonless
Day faded into twilight before they began to slow moonless darkness closing in around the fire and then Elyas spoke
----------------------------
platter
Master Fitch bustled in then followed by four women in white aprons as long as his with a platter holding three roast chickens and others bearing silver and pottery dishes and covered bowls
----------------------------
overran
Finally Perrin worked out an image of where the sun would stand in the sky when the ravens overran them from behind
----------------------------
wounded
He would hang them on the mast for an hour and those who had been wounded would finger their bandages and the mutterings quieted for a day or so at least until one or another of the crew began thinking once more that surely they had left the Trollocs far behind by now and the cycle began yet again
Wounded dying she could have lost her grip what was real
Whatever wounded the land beyond its borders hurt it too but here the wound did not go quite as deep
Only five of the Bodyguards reached Fal Moran alive every man wounded but they had the child unharmed
Wounded men wavered in their saddles
----------------------------
throne
How Thorin s son Caar came win Aridhol back to the Second Covenant and Balwen sat his throne a withered shell with the light of madness in his eyes laughing while Mordeth smiled at his side and ordered the deaths of Caar and the embassy as Friends of the Dark
Artur Hawkwing died the very day the statue was finished and his sons and the rest of his blood fought over who would sit on Hawkwing s throne
There was still a throne to be won and every lord and lady who could muster fighting men wanted it
Luc dead in the Blight before he was ever anointed First Prince of the Sword and Tigraine vanished run or dead when it came time for her to take the throne
No Daughter Heir to take the throne when the old Queen died and every House Andor scheming and fighting the right
It s time men didn t think of the throne of Andor and Aes Sedai in the same thought anymore
I daresay there are some think he s more a symbol of the Throne of Andor than the Queen is
I command you to be my First Prince of the Sword when I take the throne the light send that day is far
Those two hangings flanked a dais and on the dais a carved and gilded throne where sat the Queen
Behind the throne and to the other side a woman in deep green silk sat on a low stool knitting something out of dark almost black wool
That spirit will stand you in good stead when you ascend to the throne but you are not Queen yet child
The woman behind the throne seemed occupied with counting her stitches
Morgase did not change expression but her hands tightened on the gilded arms of her throne
Suddenly Elayne moved throwing herself onto her knees before the throne
For a time Morgase considered chin on her fist and elbow on the arm of her throne
When I took the throne I swore to uphold justice the high and the low and I will uphold it even if I am the last Andor to remember justice
Do you mean harm to the throne of Andor or to my daughter or my son
Light the Daughter Heir to the throne of Andor
Her chair by the fire suddenly seemed like a throne
She s the Daughter Heir to the throne of Andor
Lain s wife Breyan made that dare for the envy that burned her heart that al Akir had been raised to the throne instead of Lain
For revenge she plotted with Cowin Gemallan called Cowin Fairheart to seize the throne for her son Isam
Now Fairheart was a hero almost as well loved as al Akir himself and one of the Great Lords but when the Great Lords had cast the rods for king only two separated him from Akir and he never forgot that two men laying a different color the Crowning Stone would have set him the throne instead
The throne upon which the leader of the Aes Sedai sits
Daughter heir Title of the heir to the throne of Andor
The eldest daughter of the Queen succeeds her mother on the throne
Without a surviving daughter the throne goes to the nearest female blood relation of the Queen
Elayne ee LAIN Queen Morgase s daughter the Daughter heir to the Throne of Andor
Gawyn GAH wihn Queen Morgase s son Elayne s brother who will be First Prince of the Sword when Elayne ascends the throne
MAN tee ahr Tigraine s brother who would have been her First Prince of the Sword when she ascended the throne
----------------------------
daresay
I daresay there are some think he s more a symbol of the Throne of Andor than the Queen is
I daresay they seldom even think to remember they are part of the Realm
----------------------------
unsure
Master Merrilin Mat said unsure exactly what form of address to take of what Thom Merrilin had said what is happening Ghealdan
Mat seemed unsure how to take what she had said or how to reply or even whether to reply
She stopped as if unsure how to proceed
Rand felt along the wall with one hand unsure there would be a step below until his foot met it
When he was not looking they watched him openly as if unsure what he was going to do
He was unsure which he Mat meant but it changed nothing
----------------------------
everrising
Ripples ran through the ground ahead of him in everrising waves waves of dirt and rock towering over Trollocs and Fades breaking over them as the mountains shattered under their hooved feet
----------------------------
purple
Cenn s wrinkled face grew darker with every word from Tam and the Mayor until it was almost purple
His face was purple and getting darker
All the way down now and clouds hid the full moon but it still seemed like the deep purple fringes of twilight to him
by contrast the two spots in his hollow cheeks deepened from red to purple
Unwalled markets lined the road on both sides roof tiles glistening red and purple with stalls and pens in the spaces between
Inside that were even more towers and domes white and gold and purple their elevation atop the hills making them seem to look the rest of Caemlyn
It was a mass of color the newer purple blotches overlaying older ones faded into shades of brown and yellow
The purple splotches faded to brown and the brown and yellow paled some disappearing altogether
Some he knew bright golden sunburst and tiny pink tallowend crimson starblaze and purple Emond s Glory roses in every color from purest white to deep deep red but others were strange so fanciful in shape and hue he wondered if they could be real
----------------------------
passion
Why are the Whitecloaks so persistent as if they hate wolves with a passion
----------------------------
vagrant
A vagrant gust of wind brought a fragment of song from the village and smells of cooking that made his mouth water
----------------------------
strength
It took every bit of his strength to pull her into his arms
Where sunlight did reach it held neither strength nor warmth
Tam brushed aside the waterbag with an arm that seemed to have regained all of its strength
He started out as if he had had a good night s sleep but the new strength did not last long
Suddenly Rand s legs lost the little strength they had
He towered over her protectively as if he could give her strength just by being close
Now there must be both will and strength for the body to draw on or even the strongest of us can do nothing in the way of Healing
As it is he used up much of his strength in the fight for life but all that is left now is for him to recuperate
Coming closer and his strength was almost gone
It was not the valley itself that sapped his strength and filled the empty spaces left with helplessness
He plucked at his blankets with more irritation than strength
With all his heart and desperation he silently shouted at Bela to run like the wind silently tried to will strength into her
Lan grumbled that he had no need and she should not waste her strength but he did not try to stop her
But I will hold her close to mein heart and dearest memory and with her strength to steel my soul her love to warm my heart strings I will stand where we once sang though cold wind shakes the willow
It was plain that laying the false trail small as that might have seemed beside producing an earthquake and a wall of flame had taken a great deal of her strength she no longer had to lose
Some Trollocs had hooves but he doubted if any wore horseshoes especially horseshoes with the double crossbar Master Luhhan added for strength
We have to keep our strength if we re going to perform well enough to keep this crowd spending money
All of his strength seemed to go the shaking
His muscles ached like wrung out rags and had about as much strength
A mile outside the village his strength gave
A tremor ran up his legs as if to tell him he had not yet regained as much strength as he thought
We need to keep our strength if we re going to reach Tar Valon
The man looked too skeletal to have any strength but Perrin might as well have been a child
He was tall and slender but his movements spoke of whipcord strength and a sure confidence
It is for that we will shape you if you have the strength for it
All of his strength seemed to be pouring into the effort to reach Moiraine with the dagger Lan held motionless
Those stories are true and none of the Forsaken had a tenth of the strength of their master not Aginor or Lanfear not Balthamel or Demandred not even Ishamael the Betrayer of Hope himself
You can defend yourself if you have the strength for it but you must find the strength and will within yourself
You can defend yourself if you have the strength for it but you must find the strength and will within yourself
Each time you throw your puny strength against me and each time in the end you know which of us is the master
Age after Age you kneel to me or die wishing you still had strength to kneel
And as soon as he had strength to stand again he was driven
Can you doubt the strength of Manetheren s blood Lord Agelmar
Rand felt her eyes on him studying him and his friends weighing their strength and he shivered
CHAPTER Against the Shadow The land tended upward the way Rand went but fear lent his legs strength and they ate ground in long strides tearing his way through flowering bushes and tangles of wildrose scattering petals not caring if thorns ripped his clothes or even his flesh
It was not so thick as before but it still pulsed pumping strength into him pumping life filling him with the Light
By the time he reached more level ground his bruises ached twice as much but he found strength enough to stand barely
Any wielder of the One Power will have a greater degree of strength with one or possibly two of these and lesser strength in the others
Any wielder of the One Power will have a greater degree of strength with one or possibly two of these and lesser strength in the others
Some few may have great strength with three but since the Age of Legends no one has had great strength with all five
Some few may have great strength with three but since the Age of Legends no one has had great strength with all five
The degree of strength can vary greatly between individuals so that some who can channel are much stronger than others
----------------------------
docked
You re docked for the wine and breakage
----------------------------
portions
Two or three inns in a town meant a better room with two beds and more generous portions of a better cut of meat and sometimes even a few coppers in their pockets when they left besides
The portions were not as large as Rand could have wished but they were hot and filling
----------------------------
flagstone
He wandered up broad streets most paved with flagstone and down narrow twisting lanes wherever chance and the shifting of the crowd took him
